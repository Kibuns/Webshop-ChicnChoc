## Introduction
In this document we will describe the process of testing our mockups / prototypes for the user experience (UX). The main focus will be to do assisted usability tests.
The idea is to show the respondant a mockup or multiple mockups. And then give them questions and tasks to do, to ultimately find flaws or uncertainties in the design.

## Usability
Usability testing is a very valuable tool when it comes to developing good products. A great thing about it is, it's actually fairly easy to do! All you need is some respondents, and some designs.
Of course it would be good to prepare some questions. Though other than that you don't really need anything.
