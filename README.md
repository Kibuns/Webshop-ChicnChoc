## This project uses other projects as java springboot microservices:
If you fork the frontend, some features may not work if you dont also run these in the background.

<a href="https://github.com/Kibuns/WebshopCHICNCHOC-ProductService">Productservice</a> : lets frontend create read update and delete products.

<a href="https://github.com/Kibuns/WeshopOrderService">Orderservice</a> : not currently used

[Gateway](https://github.com/Kibuns/WebshopGatewayService) : a gateway that connects all of the other micro services to the frontend.
