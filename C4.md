### C4 Models

The C4 models below will explain the application architecture in different scope, getting less abstract the further you go. Below I displayed all the iterations with design process, But if you want to skip to the most recent iteration, click [here](#most-recent)

After making the design above, I started working on the application. When building it, I found out there was an easy way for me the implement a remote login service. I was also told that implementing an email system with the tools provided by fontys is rather difficult, so I scrapped that idea. After that I made some adjustments to the previous two levels of C4:

Seeing as Iâ€™m constantly refactoring the design of my application, it seemed a good idea to make use of an API gateway. This gateway acts as an abstraction layer, making it easier for the front-end to make calls and making it possible to check for authentication in one central point. I also added a discovery service, which will make it easier to scale if I ever want to do so. Though this is totally optional, since I was not planning on scaling/load balancing in the first place.
