# Contributing
This document described the preffered way of working on this project, regarding how to work on issues. and make pull requests.

## Issues and User Stories
Prettymuch every issue is linked to a user story. When looking in the project board, you can see these user stories as cards, or as issues in the issue tab with the label "User Story".
The issues that don't really link to a user story are often things regarding certain markdown files.

### Making an issue
When making an issue, keep in mind that you will have to justify it by linking it with a user story. Think about how solving your issue could contribute to the development of that user story.
This excludes things like typo's etc. It's also an option to not link any user story, but this issue could promptly be closed by the student who manages this project, if he thinks it doesn't add to his vision of the project

### Working on an issue
When you want to work on an issue, be sure to comment something along the lines of "I'll be working on this", so that me and other people know that this issue is being worked on.
After forking the project, be sure to make a branch. This branch name should look like the following

```#{issue number}-Name```

for example:

```#42069-fix-typos-readme```. 

### Making a Pull Request
When you think you solved the issue, make sure to make a Pull Request into master. You don't have to assign anyone to review. Since this is a school project mainly worked on by one student, who also manages it. So it will most likely be picked up by him.
